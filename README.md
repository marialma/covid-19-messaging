# Messaging surrounding COVID19 

Hi. I'm Maria Ma. I have an MPH in Infectious Diseases from UC Berkeley. My undergrad degree is in Microbiology, and I spent several years working as a biotech professional before transitioning to public health. I tell you my qualifications to let you decide whether or not you can trust my judgement as to what the best known data is so far. 

# What's in here

* **[what_we_know_en.md](what_we_know_en.md)** is a living document that will contain information that will be as up to date as I can make it. The git commit history will have the information as needed. 
* **[20200301_practical_advice_en.md](20200301_practical_advice_en.md)** is a document that was originally jointly crafted in a Google Doc by many others, containing the key things we wanted our communities to know. I can't take credit for any of this. Thank you to all the wonderful folks who helped out on this. This is undergoing translation into multiple languages, to be shared with friends and family that might be missed by more typical communications.

Either submit an issue if you have more questions, or email me. If you dig around, my email is on my website.
