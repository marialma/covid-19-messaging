Hi. I'm Maria Ma. I have an MPH in Infectious Diseases from UC Berkeley. My undergrad degree is in Microbiology, and I spent several years working as a biotech professional before transitioning to public health. I tell you my qualifications to let you decide whether or not you can trust the information I sifted through.

Some key takeaways:
*  Using even the most generous estimates of asymptomatic individuals, most people have symptoms. If you're not surrounded by people coughing, **you're probably not surrounded by people with the virus.**
* **We are still learning about this.** It's a brand new virus. We're learning about this faster than we ever have before. Truly bold new technologies are being applied by the scientists trying to figure this stuff out. You might feel like we don't have enough information, but actually having this much information at this stage of an outbreak of a new virus is completely unprecedented. 
* **It's going to take some time.** Vaccine development will take a while. Finding and testing cases will take a while. Recovery even takes a while. 
* **Responders are human too.** They will get tired. Try not to harass them too much or spread too many wild theories that make their job harder. 

# COVID-19/ SARS-CoV-2 Information

A lot of the latest information these days is actually off of Twitter, as many top researchers are using it to quickly share information with large groups of people.

Here's a list of good people to follow. They are all either journalists or researchers:

## So uh, what's it actually called?
COVID-19 is the name of the disease.

SARS-CoV-2 is the name of the virus.

SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19, the same way that the influenza virus causes the flu. Sorry, I know it's confusing.  


Before it was formally named, people were generally using the terms novel coronavirus, nCoV, and "Wuhan pneumonia" to refer to the disease/ virus.

## I heard the R0 was really high!

Eeeugh. This is tough.

The R0 is a value that represents the average number of new infections that will stem from a single infection. An R0 of 1 means that for every new infection, one other person will be infected. **This number is NOT and immutable characteristic of a disease, but rather an estimate that changes based on the social dynamics of the outbreak as well.** Implementing control measures changes the R0. This might seem pedantic, but citing an R0 tends to be a little misleading without understanding this context.

Mathematically, R0 is a function of an infected person's infectious contact rate (β) * the average infectious period (γ).  The infectious contact rate is the number of contacts you have made * your likelihood of having infected them. Each part of this is affected by different things - your likelihood of having infected a contact would be a biological property, but the number of contacts you have would be a property of the social dynamics.

*The goal of every outbreak epidemiologist is to reduce the R0 to below one, so that the outbreak will die out.*


## What are the symptoms?

Symptoms have generally been described as nonspecific, involving fever, cough, and shortness of breath ([CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/symptoms.html)).

## What is the incubation period?

The incubation period is a bit tough to pin down exactly, but [appears to be, on average, about **5.1** days](https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2762808/incubation-period-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-from-publicly-reported), with 97.5% of patients developing symptoms by 11.5 days. This study was done with secondhand data, but the results are consistent with other studies. As we see more cases in the US, unfortunately, we will be able to confirm this number.

In general, people have been using 14 days/ 2 weeks as the benchmark.

## How long does it survive on surfaces?
Results from a preprint on medrxiv were leaked earlier. This space will be updated when that preprint goes live. But generally, it doesn't seem to be hugely different from what you'd expect from a coronavirus.

## What is attack rate? What percentage of cases are mild or asymptomatic?

It's hard to say what number of exposed people go on to actually develop the disease. Because of the way different countries are testing, we aren't necessarily able to say what number of truly exposed people have developed disease.

According to the WHO & WHO Director General Dr. Tedros, very few confirmed cases were asymptomatic. However, we can't actually get a true answer [until we can do serological testing](https://twitter.com/kakape/status/1234872706069344261)... which China has just developed a test for. This will let us figure out the actual number of people who had been infected and fought off the infection.

However, this seems to conflict with this not-peer-reviewed preprint looking at [the Princess Diamond data](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.20025866v2), which implied an 18% asymptomatic rate.

There are very many biologically plausible explanations for this discrepancy, and **we will know more about asymptomatics and the attack rate as time goes on**.

## How bad is it?

**80% of cases are considered mild**. **20% have severe disease**, which means they were put on respiratory support machines & experienced pretty scary complications. [WHO Sitrep](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200301-sitrep-41-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=6768306d_2)

However, it's not super clear to me what "mild cases" means. There was something in the WHO mission report that "mild" meant you didn't have to be intubated but might still be hospitalized. We will find out more from South Korea and Seattle. 

But, it does seem that when people are sick, they seem to be sick for a long period of time (>20 days). This has worrying implications for the US hospital system. 

## Who's going to get it? Who's gonna die?

As time goes on, we'll learn more about the virus and its patterns as we just deal with it. South Korea, China, and Singapore are offering pretty good information.

Per the [report from China CDC](http://www.ourphn.org.au/wp-content/uploads/20200225-Article-COVID-19.pdf) :

In China, 86.6% of diagnosed patients were between the ages of 30-79. About 70% of the patients were between the ages of 40-79. Curiously, young children appear to be almost unaffected, though they can still get the disease and potentially transmit it. However, because of how China was doing the diagnosing at the time this report came out,

Per the [report from China CDC](http://www.ourphn.org.au/wp-content/uploads/20200225-Article-COVID-19.pdf), the highest mortality rate is in the >80 crowd, with almost 15% mortality.

## Can asymptomatic people transmit the disease?
To the best of our knowledge, the answer is yes, **however**, it requires close contact.

Early on in the epidemic, there appeared to be [a case where one person had asymptomatically transmitted the disease](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2001468) to coworkers abroad. However, it turns out that [the original authors of the paper had not interviewed the first case](https://www.jwatch.org/na50871/2020/02/07/clarification-asymptomatic-2019-ncov-transmission-germany) about what symptoms she had. She was, in fact, symptomatic.

However, there was at least one case in China of [an asymptomatic patient transmitting disease](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2820%2930154-9/fulltext) to their family.

## Can recovered people transmit the disease?

We know that people can test positive for some time after they've fully recovered. However, we don't actually know if this means that they are infectious. Because the current test is a PCR test, it only tells us if that person has virus fragments in them. We don't know if those virus fragments can infect anyone else or not.

## Can you get it more than once?

There have been some reports that say that you can get infected twice. However, even if this were truly the case for this patient, this would be exceedingly rare, and much more likely the result of false negatives.

## What is going on with testing?
Currently, due to a series of bungled missteps from the federal government, the US has not actually tested very many people. This involved the CDC inexplicably trying to develop its own test (which did not work), which meant that useful test kits were not given to health departments for a while.

##  What's with the US' case counts? We don't have that many!
The thing about diagnosing diseases is that you're going to have to first go look for them. If you don't look for them, you'll never find them. We know there's community transmission going on; we just don't know how much. 

**However, you should not take this to mean that everyone around you is infected.**  Consider: using even the most generous estimates of asymptomatic individuals, most people have symptoms. If you're not surrounded by people coughing, **you're probably not surrounded by people with the virus.**

## Do I have to pay for the test? Will I have to pay for treatment?

In Washington State and in California, the governors have stated that all costs associated with testing will be covered. However, for other costs, such as for ERs, I cannot give you any definitive answer. You will have to call your insurance company for guidance.

## Where do I / How can I get a test?

Talk to your physician. The CDC/ Coronavirus task force has made it up to the local level to decide what testing guidances are. In some places, despite demonstrated local transmission, they may still require you to be a close contact of a case, or have recent travel.

Labcorp and Quest are two diagnostic companies that have just finished developing an LDT ([laboratory developed test, which is a specific FDA designation](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/vitro-diagnostics/laboratory-developed-tests)) that can be ordered by your physician. Otherwise, testing is done in hospital clinical labs or at the state public health lab.

## When are we going to get a vaccine?

Anthony Fauci suggests the fastest we could get a vaccine is a [year to a year and a half.](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-long-will-it-take-to-develop-a-coronavirus-vaccine) This is an extremely responsible estimate, given the amount of time it'll take to figure out if the vaccine is safe & works, and time to actually produce and deliver the vaccine.

So, given clinical trials, you might be able to get the vaccine earlier, but there's no guarantee that it will work. 

Basically, don't hold your breath. 


# SF Specific

## What's happening in San Francisco?
San Francisco declared a state of emergency. This sounds scary, but is mostly a way to access resources that they need to fight the outbreak.

## How many beds do hospitals in San Francisco have?
The City of San Francisco has three hospitals, with 1,400 beds between them. I do not know how many isolation rooms there are. 

## How many cases have been in the Bay Area? 


# Frequently asked questions

## Should I work from home?
Probably, if you can. Try to reduce the burden on those who can't. 

## Should I travel?
Wouldn't exactly recommend it, especially if you have older family that you're in contact with a lot. But, if you insist on it, absolutely do not go while sick and promptly quarantine yourself if you develop symptoms. 

Also recognize, depending on where you're going, a ton of shit's probably closed anyway, and there is a non-zero chance of getting officially quarantined on your way back. 

## Should I stock up on masks? What measures can I take?

The typical refrain: wash your hands, don't touch your face, avoid large crowds, make sure you have your emergency kit. Wear a mask only if you're sick

Masks will provide some marginal level of protection, but most people also use masks incorrectly which might lead to them actually putting themselves at greater risk. The value a mask provides is kind of dependent on how many sick people are actually around you. 

Additionally, there will definitely be a mask shortage for our healthcare workers, who are in constant contact with infectious particles. You should not hoard masks when health workers need them the most. It is in your best, selfish interest for those people to not get sick. If too many health workers get sick, it'll cripple a hospital, resulting in worse outcomes for sick people, and even less ability to control the outbreak. But, you should still wear a mask if you're sick, to prevent infecting anyone else. 

Many respiratory infections are actually from people with dirty hands touching their faces and inoculating themselves with pathogen. So, wash your hands and don't touch your face.

Generally speaking, make sure you've got at least 2 weeks of food. You should have this anyway if you're in SF. It's earthquake country after all, and you should make sure you have an emergency kit. 

## Exercise ...? 
One of the other guides going around tells you to do aerobic exercise to "strengthen your lungs". I deeply resent this wording - your lungs aren't like a muscle. You can improve your lung capacity, but you can't just 'strengthen your lungs'  

BUT exercise can help strengthen your immune system. So does eating healthy foods, *especially* getting enough sleep, not drinking excessively, and not stressing out. [Hahhvahd](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/coronavirus-resource-center)

So, really, one of the best things you can do for yourself is to just go to bed and not try to obsessively follow the latest scraps of news.

# Concluding remarks
Anyway, I urge you to take care, but be mindful of others. The only way we beat epidemics is to beat them together. Selfishness will harm others and make it harder for things to go "back to normal". Try not to scare others on purpose and offer help (while taking precautions) if your friends and neighbors need it. Every man for himself is not the way to do things here.
